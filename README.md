# 4-Gallon-Bucket-Problem
The objective of this project is to develop a Python program that simulates and solves the classic water jug problem: measuring exactly **4 gallons **of water using only an unmarked 3-gallon bucket and an unmarked 5-gallon bucket, in less than **15 steps**.

Two kids are tasked with fetching exactly **4 gallons** of water from a stream. However, they are only given:

One **3-gallon bucket**

One **5-gallon bucket**

Neither bucket has any measurement markings.

They must use a sequence of fill, pour, and empty operations to arrive at exactly **4 gallons** in one of the buckets.
